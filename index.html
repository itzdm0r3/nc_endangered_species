    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The State of North Carolina is home to numerous endangered species. 
        As of July 2016, 35 animals have been included on the list.
        Animals such as the <em>Carolina Nothern Flying squirrel</em>
        who make their home in the state have found themselves 
        on the brink of extinction.</p>
    <p>According to a report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
        the habitats important to species like the Flying squirrel are under
        threat from environmental factors such as: pests, pollution, development,
        and climate change. If you would like to read a copy of the report
        click <a href="https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc4177.pdf">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Due to the continued raise in population throughout the Southern Appalachians,
        the displacement of these species is occuring at such an alarming rate that futher
        studies are taking place to see if recovery is even possible.
    </p>
    <p><i>The purpose of this webpage is to spread awareness of the growing issue
        of species becoming endangered in North Carolina (and its surrounding areas)
        due to the above mentioned environmental factors.</i>
