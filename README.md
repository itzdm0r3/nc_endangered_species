# nc_endangered_species
files for nc endangered species website

This project is about building a website dedicated to informing the public about the endangered species that exist in the State of North Carolina. I decided to create this project in order to begin building a GitHub portfolio and network with other web designers/developers.

Completing this project to its fullest potential will require skills in HTML/CSS and Javascript. Personally, I am using Visual Studio Code to work on the site and post changes to the repository.

This is an excellent project for those who wish to work on their markup and GitHub workflow skills. If you have any questions please contact me here or leave a DM on Twitter.
